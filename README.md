# React Global State Comparison
Comparison between two global state strategies: **Redux** (both the connect() useService() functions) and **React Context API**.

**⚠ Over Engineering Context API:** I wanted to show how one could separate state values and functions into different Providers using the Context API similar to what it is done when using Redux reducers and actions. The final result is still simpler than Redux code but you could simplify it even more just putting your context, Provider and state into a single `context/index.js` file or just putting it all into `App.js` component.

## Redux

### Suggested File Structure
```
+-- 📁 src
|   +-- 📁 redux
|     +-- 📁 actions
|       +-- 📄 actions1.js
|       ...
|       +-- 📄 actions9.js
|       +-- 📄 index.js
|     +-- 📁 reducers
|       +-- 📄 reducer1.js
|       ...
|       +-- 📄 reducer9.js
|       +-- 📄 index.js
|     +-- 📄 index.js
```

### Redux Configuration Steps
1. **Create the file structure** with at least one reducer file inside `reducers` folder and one actions file inside `actions` folder;
2. **Create your reducer functions** in separate files: one for each 'dominion' of your global state; after this, unify them all using `combineReducers` and export this 'one reducer to rule them all' as `rootReducer` (or whatever you wanna call it) in the `reducers/index.js` file;
3. **Create your action functions** inside `actions/index.js`; if your global state is of high complexicity is possible to separete them into differente files and export them all at once in the `actions/index.js` just like you did with the reducers;
4. **Create and export a `store`** on the `redux/index.js` using the `createStore` function and the root reducer created in the previous step;
4. **Create and export a `ReduxProvider`** on the `redux/index.js` file using the `Provider` component from the `react-redux` library and having the `{children}` as child of said component;
it's possible to not export this component and directly wrap your app with the `react-redux.Provider` component on the `index.js` or `App.js` files but in this case you'll need to import both `Provider` and your `store` in said files;
5. **Wrap your application with a Provider** in the `src/index.js` or `App.js` files using the `Provider` created in the previous step;
6. **Connect a component** with the store using `connect`, `mapStateAsProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` or **use the new react-redux hooks** `useSelector` and `useDispatch`;

## React Context API

### Suggested File Structure
```
+-- 📁 src
|   +-- 📁 context
|     +-- 📄 context1.js
|     ...
|     +-- 📄 index.js
```

### React Context API Configuration Steps
1. **Create the file structure**: if multiple providers are to be exported you can create separeted files to each `Provider` or simply put all your state in the `index.js` file;
2. **Create and export a context** in the `context/index.js` file using `createContext()`;
3. **Create and export a provider component** with whatever state (including functions similar to the **reducer actions**) is needed and make it return the previously created context `Provider`, rendering the `children` prop;
4. **Import your provider component** in the `App.js` component and wrap the children components who are going to access the sate;
5. **Get the state using `useContext`** on the child component passing as argument the `Context` previously created;
